# Byte-Shrink: File Compressor Tool
This text file compression tool leverages the Huffman encoding algorithm to provide lossless data compression. By employing Huffman encoding, the tool can compress files by 30-40% while preserving the original data integrity. This results in significant space savings of up to 70%, making it highly effective for managing large files. The tool is particularly beneficial for cloud storage and file sharing, where efficient use of space and reduced data transfer times are crucial.
